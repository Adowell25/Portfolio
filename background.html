                        <p>As a server engineer on the IT Operations team I have been primarily responsible for SCCM, Backups,
                            and Data Center management. I have been able to see all projects to completetion while
                            also supervising our level 2 team as they work within the backups, SCCM, or datacenter envrionments.
                            Being on the L3 team the majority of my work project focused, but due to Covid we all 
                            as a team have collectively jumped back into the day to day operations to ensure the the business
                            is performing at the expected level.

                    <p>
                        <p>Working with Acadia I was on contract to help facilitate the migration
                            of acquired Behavioral Health facilities. There were 34 outstanding facilities
                            that had been bought over the course of the prior years but nothing had been done 
                            to bring them into the Acadia domain. 

                            Responsibilites included running the discovery process for each facilitiy and external
                            domain to analyze  the system setup and provide recommendations on next steps. There was 
                            also some cloud exposure with MS Azure, and the cloud Vrealize Suite-VMware 6.5. I was able 
                            to complete the project before schedule and without any setbacks.

                    <p>
                        <p>At Geodis I was able to wear many hats and have my hands in multiple 
                            projects. As the the only junior admin on the team, I was primary in day
                            to day support. Which including working all tickets and facilitating those
                            incidents that required senior level input. I was also ran the administration 
                            of the company Sharepoint page.

                            As I continued to grow within the position, I able gain the position running 
                            the backup and recovery software enterprise wide. This opportunity was a great and 
                            challenging experience. I was able to perform 2 in-place upgrades to get meet industry
                            standards and increased the overall success rate to 90%+ across the board.

                            Another challening, but rewarding experience was being on the team to that migrated
                            Exchange on Prem to O365 in the cloud. I was personally responsible for the Sharepoint and 
                            OneDrive portion of the O365 suite, but also heavily involved in the Exchange portions
                            as well.</p>
